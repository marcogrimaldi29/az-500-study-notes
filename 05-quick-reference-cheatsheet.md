## 🚦 Conditional Access — Quick Reference

### Always configure CA for:
- All **Global Administrators** — require phishing-resistant MFA
- All users — block **legacy authentication** (most important CA policy)
- Risky sign-ins (P2) — require MFA or block based on risk level
- External access to privileged apps — require compliant device

### CA Policy = IF (Conditions) + THEN (Grant/Session Controls)

```
IF:  User = All Users
     App  = All Cloud Apps
     Client Apps = Legacy auth protocols (Exchange ActiveSync, IMAP, POP3, SMTP)
THEN: Block Access
```

## 📐 Azure Policy Effects — Order of Importance for Exam

```
Disabled → Audit → AuditIfNotExists → Append → Modify → DeployIfNotExists → Deny
```

| For blocking: | **Deny** |
| For auditing only: | **Audit** |
| For auto-fixing existing resources: | **DeployIfNotExists** + remediation task |
| For adding missing companion resources: | **DeployIfNotExists** |
| For auto-tagging: | **Modify** |

## 🔐 Zero Trust Principles — Mapped to Services

| Principle | Azure Service |
|-----------|-------------|
| Verify Explicitly | Entra ID, Conditional Access, MFA |
| Least Privilege | RBAC, PIM, JIT, Managed Identity |
| Assume Breach | NSG, Private Endpoints, Defender for Cloud, Sentinel |

## ⚠️ All Exam Traps in One Place

| Topic | The Trap |
|-------|---------|
| NSG priority | **Lower = higher priority** (100 > 200 > 65500) |
| NSG evaluation | Subnet NSG first, then NIC NSG (inbound) |
| VNet Peering | **Not transitive** — A↔B↔C ≠ A↔C |
| Contributor role | **Cannot assign RBAC** — only Owner / User Access Admin |
| PIM licence | **Requires Entra ID P2** |
| CA Report-only mode | **Does NOT enforce** — only logs |
| Delegated vs App permissions | App permissions **always need admin consent** |
| Service Endpoint | **Does NOT create private IP** — traffic still uses public service IP |
| Private Endpoint | Needs **private DNS zone** for correct name resolution |
| ADE vs SSE | **Independent layers** — ADE = OS level, SSE = storage layer |
| Always Encrypted | Protects from **DBAs** — Dynamic Masking does NOT |
| ACR admin account | **Should be disabled** — use Managed Identity + AcrPull |
| Bastion subnet | Exact name: **AzureBastionSubnet**, min **/26** |
| JIT VM Access | Requires **Defender for Servers** (any plan) |
| WAF Detection mode | **Logs only** — does NOT block |
| Purge protection | **Cannot be disabled** once enabled |
| Key Vault RBAC vs Policies | RBAC is **preferred** — access policies are legacy |
| Custom role scope | Minimum assignable scope = **Resource Group** |
| DeployIfNotExists | Requires **managed identity** on policy assignment |
| Fusion rules | Detect **multi-stage attacks** — other rules = single signals |
| User-Assigned MI | Shared across multiple resources; **independent lifecycle** |
| DDoS Standard | Protects **Public IPs** — not private IPs |
| Client secrets | Max **2 years** — prefer certificate credentials |
| AKS Workload Identity | Modern replacement for pod-managed identity — use OIDC |

## ✅ Pre-Exam Checklist

### Domain 1 — Identity & Access (15–20%)
- [ ] Know RBAC scope hierarchy and inheritance direction
- [ ] Understand PIM eligible vs active vs permanent assignments
- [ ] Know which licence PIM and Conditional Access require
- [ ] Understand Delegated vs Application OAuth permissions
- [ ] Know System-Assigned vs User-Assigned Managed Identity lifecycle
- [ ] Know that Contributor cannot assign RBAC roles

### Domain 2 — Secure Networking (20–25%)
- [ ] NSG rule priority order (lower = higher priority)
- [ ] NSG vs ASG — ASG is logical grouping for NSG rules
- [ ] Private Endpoint vs Service Endpoint differences
- [ ] Azure Firewall rule processing order: DNAT → Network → App
- [ ] WAF modes: Detection (logs only) vs Prevention (blocks)
- [ ] DDoS Standard protects Public IPs; includes SLA-backed cost credit
- [ ] Network Watcher IP Flow Verify — troubleshoot NSG issues

### Domain 3 — Compute, Storage & DBs (20–25%)
- [ ] Bastion subnet: exact name + minimum /26
- [ ] JIT VM Access requires Defender for Servers
- [ ] ADE (OS layer) vs SSE (storage layer) — independent, can combine
- [ ] Always Encrypted protects from DBAs; Dynamic Masking does not
- [ ] TDE is default on for Azure SQL (PMK); add CMK for BYOK
- [ ] Key Vault: prefer RBAC over access policies; enable soft delete + purge protection
- [ ] ACR admin account should be disabled

### Domain 4 — Defender & Sentinel (30–35%)
- [ ] Defender for Cloud = CSPM (Secure Score) + CWP (workload plans)
- [ ] Agentless scanning requires Defender for Servers **Plan 2**
- [ ] Fusion rules detect multi-stage attacks via ML correlation
- [ ] Automation Rules = fast/simple (in Sentinel); Playbooks = Logic Apps (complex)
- [ ] DCRs = modern log collection for Sentinel (replaces legacy agent)
- [ ] DeployIfNotExists policy effect requires managed identity on assignment
- [ ] Custom compliance standards: create initiative in Azure Policy → add to Defender for Cloud

## 🎯 Final Exam Strategy

1. **Read the full question** before looking at answers — identify the constraint (cost, compliance, security level)
2. **Eliminate wrong answers first** — usually 2 options are obviously wrong
3. **Zero Trust lens** — "which option most restricts access / assumes breach?"
4. **Private Endpoint wins** over Service Endpoint almost every time
5. **RBAC wins** over shared keys/secrets almost every time
6. **Managed Identity wins** over stored credentials almost every time
7. If asked about **Defender for Cloud vs Sentinel**: Defender = posture + workloads; Sentinel = SIEM/SOAR + investigation
